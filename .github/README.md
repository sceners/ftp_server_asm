```
; Simple FTP server. It has some bugs but I haven't had time to fix them.
; Passiva and some other important functions are not implemented. I will try
; add it in the next versions. It also doesn't have file permissions. Each
; user (anonymous also - if enabled) has full access to all
; files (rwxrwxrwx). This is quite a serious flaw, but I'm already working on it :)
; What else ... the number of (l) users limited to 20 ... By the way
; it could be written a little better, but I still don't have enough time :(
; There are no comments in the center ... so it turned out 8-]
; No to enjoy ... ^ D logout
